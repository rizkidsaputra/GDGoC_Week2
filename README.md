# Simple CRUD with JavaScript (Node.js) - GDGoC Week 2

## Project Description
This project is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** implementation in **JavaScript** running on **Node.js**. It is designed to manipulate an array of objects representing a list of notes.  

This task is based on the **Intermediate JavaScript** material from **GDGOC Telkom University**, covering fundamental JavaScript concepts such as **arrays, objects, and data manipulation using functions**.  

## Features
1. **Create (`createNote`)** → Adds a new note to the list.
2. **Read (`readNote`)** → Displays all stored notes.
3. **Update (`updateNote`)** → Updates a note by its ID.
4. **Delete (`deleteNote`)** → Deletes a note by its ID.
